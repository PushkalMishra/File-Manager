This Python script provides a basic file manager with the following functions:

list_files(): Lists files and directories in a specified path.
rename(): Renames a file in a given directory.
create(): Creates a new directory within a specified path.
remove(): Allows you to remove either a file or an empty directory, with a menu-driven choice.
The main() function presents a menu to the user, allowing them to choose from these options. It keeps running until the user decides to quit. The script makes use of the os module to perform file and directory operations. It provides a simple command-line interface for basic file management tasks like listing, renaming, creating, and removing files and directories.# File-Manager
